### EntityCrudValidator
Have you ever required to add restrictions (Add, Update, Delete) per entity type, and not for all entity types as the native inRiver behaviour proposed? Here's all the info: [https://absotech.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/INRIVER/pages/165281796/EntityCrudValidator](https://absotech.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/INRIVER/pages/165281796/EntityCrudValidator).

### CVLValue Cleanup
Natively, when a CVL Value is deleted, the entities that use this CVL Value are not cleaned up. The "CVL Value Key" stays on the field type, which prevents the entity update unless you change the field type that used the CVL. Furthermore, by keeping this deleted CVL Value on the entity, you could erroneous data to your 3rd party solution. Here's an extension that will clean the entities using the deleted CVL Value: [https://absotech.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/INRIVER/pages/167706625/CVL+Value+Cleanup](https://absotech.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/INRIVER/pages/167706625/CVL+Value+Cleanup).
